## Introduction
The scientific calculator, however, is the only one that can handle certain functions in fields such as trigonometry, physics, chemistry, and engineering. They have almost completely replaced slide rules in almost all traditional applications, and are widely used in both education and professional settings. In certain contexts such as higher education, scientific calculators have been superseded by graphing calculators, which offer a superset of scientific calculator functionality along with the ability to graph input data and write and store programs for the device.
## Research
The Scientific calculator doesn't involve any complex operations or any operations. It is easy to apply the values in the system to find the required result rather than remembering and applying it in formula. Thus by studying all these facts, the necessary functions has been implemented to get the required results in a better way.
