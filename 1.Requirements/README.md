# Requirements
## Introduction
The scientific calculator, however, is the only one that can handle certain functions in fields such as trigonometry, physics, chemistry, and engineering. They have almost completely replaced slide rules in almost all traditional applications, and are widely used in both education and professional settings. In certain contexts such as higher education, scientific calculators have been superseded by graphing calculators, which offer a superset of scientific calculator functionality along with the ability to graph input data and write and store programs for the device.
## Research
The Scientific calculator doesn't involve any complex operations or any operations. It is easy to apply the values in the system to find the required result rather than remembering and applying it in formula. Thus by studying all these facts, the necessary functions has been implemented to get the required results in a better way.
## Defining our system

# 4W's and 1'H
## Who:
* Any student, developer or an enterprise organization those who are looking for an open-source scientific calculator can use. All the students and employess who requires the calculations will use the program to find their answer. The main objective of this project is the user should be satisfied with freindly interface and fast calculation.
## What:
* During many large-scale projects, the presence of an independent scalable scientific calculator stays missing which might create an issue.
* We can except the results that user can perform mathematical operations like arthimetic , Trigonometric & Scientific operations.
* All the basics functionalities are included in the project. User can use the program efficiently and get the required results.
## When:
* this project can be used for complex calculations and also open source and can be used anywhere for calculations
## How:
* This project is implemented in c language with visual studio in both linux and windows OS
* Code is developed with industry standard testing and code quality and it also follows multi-file approach.
